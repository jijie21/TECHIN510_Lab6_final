# Lab 6 - AI Resume feedback bot 

## Overview
An AI Resume Feedback Bot is an innovative tool designed to assist job seekers in enhancing their resumes and cover letters. By leveraging artificial intelligence, this bot provides users with the ability to upload their resume and cover letter and receive instant, tailored feedback.

## Project Structure
app.py: Script for the chatbot interface by using streamlit

## How to Run
1. `python -m venv venv`
2. `source venv/bin/activate`
3. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. `cp .env.sample .env`
5. Change the `.env` file to match your environment

## Reflection
During the development of AI Resume feedback bot, I have learned how to intergrate the openAI API with Streamlit, and build a basic LLM chat app. This experience has sharpened my technical abilities and built my knowledge to my final project.
